# Synchronising

How to synchronise two HashBrown projects

If you want a project to inherit schemas, settings and content from another one, you've come to the right place.

1. Create a new project by going to the dashboard (the root page) and clicking "Add project", if you haven't already
2. Click the ellipsis (⋮) in the top right corner
3. Click "Settings"
4. Enter the URL of the HashBrown instance the parent project lives on in the "API URL" field
5. Enter the id of the parent project (can be found by looking at the URL when inside the project)
6. Click on the refresh button (⭮) to get a new token
7. Enter the username and password of an account with access to the parent project
8. Click the checkmark (✔) to receive your new token
9. Don't forget to check the "enabled" box before clicking "Save"

Now you should see the child project inheriting settings, content and schemas from the parent project you specified
